# Visual Flow Editor Project

This project is a Node-RED-inspired visual flow editor with drag-and-drop functionality, canvas workspace, and node wiring capabilities.

## Project Overview
A complete visual flow editor built with vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript that provides:
- Drag-and-drop node palette with multiple node types
- SVG-based canvas workspace with zoom and pan
- Visual node connection system with Bézier curves  
- Real-time property editing and configuration
- Export/import functionality for flow persistence
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet use

## Architecture
- **Frontend-only**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript with no build process
- **SVG Graphics**: Scalable vector graphics for crisp rendering
- **Modular Design**: Separate files for core editor, node types, and UI
- **Event-Driven**: Loosely coupled components via DOM events

## Development Approach
- Modern web standards without frameworks
- Progressive enhancement for accessibility
- Mobile-friendly responsive design
- Clean, maintainable code structure
